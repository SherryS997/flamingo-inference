## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and use the AudioFlamingo API:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/audioflamingo-inference.git
   cd audioflamingo-inference
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the model checkpoints (ensure you comply with the license terms):
   ```
   # Command to download checkpoints (if applicable)
   ```

4. Start the API server:
   ```
   python inference/inference_endpoint.py
   ```

5. Use the API:
   - Send POST requests to `http://localhost:5000/chat` with JSON data in the following format:
     ```json
     {
       "audio_file": "path/to/audio/file.wav",
       "dialogue": [
         {"user": "What genre does this music belong to?"},
         {"user": "Can you describe the vocals in this track?"}
       ]
     }
     ```
   - You can use the provided client script to interact with the API:
     ```
     python inference/client.py
     ```
